#' @description gRoot is a prototype tool for visualising and interacting with 
#'   the Urban Forest data around Cardiff. Quick start - run `launch_app()`
#'   
#' @details There are three main components of this package: the data required 
#'   for the city profile prototype tool, functions for manipulating and
#'   visualising this data and a shiny app to interact with the data. The
#'   visualisation functions are used in the shiny app. The functions are
#'   developed specifically to work with the data for this app and while effort has
#'   been made to make these functions usable for other datasets, this is not
#'   completed in all cases.
